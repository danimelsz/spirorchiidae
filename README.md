## Abstract
Recent studies have suggested that Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is the etiological agent of fibropapillomatosis (FP), a neoplastic disease that affects sea turtles, and it is hypothesized that parasites such as trematodes and marine leeches are the mechanical vectors of ChHV5. However, no molecular data is currently available for most trematodes of sea turtles from the South Atlantic Ocean. Here we aim to (i) provide the first molecular insights of Spirorchiidae from Brazil and (ii) evaluate 59 parasites of Ozobranchus, Pronocephalidae, and Spirorchiidae to test the mechanical vector hypothesis. Our phylogenetic tree supports that neither Spirorchiidae nor Hapalotrema are monophyletic. A high genetic diversity was found among specimens of Learedius, which suggests the necessity to assess candidate haplotypes or even different species. Histopathology revealed type I spirorchiid eggs affecting the turtle lungs, and although reports of internal tumors have been rare in Brazil, we found a lung fibroma in which there were spirorchiid eggs. Although recent studies have found evidence that favors the mechanical vector hypothesis, ChHV5 was not detected in our parasite samples.
